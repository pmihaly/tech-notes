# measuring latency (percentiles)

- latency: idle time in the network (not to be confused with [[1706369661-OCDA|response time]])

- prefer percentiles over averages
  - "whats the worst case scenario?"
  - "out of 100 requests, whats the response time of the 100 - X worst requests"

- median
  - p50
  - "users typically need to wait X ms to get an answer"

- tail latencies
  - p90, p95, p99
  - users with the slowest requests may have the most data - they are maybe the most valuable users
  - affects a small amount of requests
  - optimization may be hard and not worth it
